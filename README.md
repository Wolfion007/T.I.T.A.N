"INTEGRATION OF  RASPBERRY PI 4 AND YOLO V8 FOR PRECISION LASER-GUIDED TARGET DETECTION AND TRACKING IN LOITERING APPLICATIONS"

The Tactical Indigenous Targeted Aerial Navigator for Loitering (TITAN.L) marks a significant advancement in the evolution of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), introducing a Raspberry Pi 4-based loitering munition for precise target identification and neutralization in conflict zones. This research integrates the YOLOv8 object recognition algorithm with the Raspberry Pi 4, leveraging its computational process to process visual data from a Pi Camera for accurate target detection and tracking. The system employs a servo motor to direct a laser towards detected targets, confirmed by a laser light sensor, with real-time location tracking facilitated by integrated GPS. With integrated GPS for real-time location tracking executes missions, communicating with a base station for enhanced operational efficiency. 
 Once a target is confirmed, the Raspberry Pi initiates necessary actions, including autonomous navigation or decision-making processes. This comprehensive system offers potential applications in surveillance, reconnaissance, loitering and other fields requiring precise target acquisition and tracking.
